# SoulSeeker
An Asheron's Call PvP / macro assist plugin. Features include:

-PK Logout, Low Comps Logout, Vitae Logout

-Alt+F4 Alternative Logout

-Friends Database

-Sounds

-Allegiance Chat Alert

The original goal was better integration with Thwargle Launcher's "Auto Relaunch".
You *must* enable Alt+F4 and change line 21 in Thwargle.exe.config to the following:
    <add key="NewGameTitle" value="%CHARACTER%" />
